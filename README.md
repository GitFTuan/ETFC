# ETFC
Deep learning-based multi-functional therapeutic peptides prediction wih an imbalance-compensating weighted loss funcation


## Introduction
In this paper, we develop a novel deep neural network-based MLC model named ETFC to predict MFPTs. This work has the following advantages over existing methods:  
(1) In the ETFC model, semantic-based and position-based embedding block combined with MHSA can capture more peptide sequence information, and text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) could extract the more effective information from peptide sequence.  
(2) To handle the imbalance problem in the MLC dataset, we design a novel loss function, termed multi-label focal dice loss (MLFDL), for MLC based on FL and dice loss (DL). MLFDL can dynamically assign weights to labels by exploiting label correlations to improve the prediction performance.   
(3) We use the teacher-student-based knowledge distillation to obtain the importance of AA and quantify their contributions towards each of the investigated activities.  

The framework of the ETFC method for MFTP prediction is described as follows:

The teacher-student framework for knowledge distillation is exhibited as follows:
